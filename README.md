# 🚗 CarCare System - Web API Project

The **CarCare System** is a complete web-based application built with ASP.NET Core using Onion Architecture. It facilitates the interaction between Users and technicians, allowing users to request vehicle services, track request statuses, manage vehicles, and more. It supports role-based access (Admin, technician, User), with advanced features like background jobs, image handling, validation, and secure authentication.

## 🧩 Features

### Phase 01: Foundations
- Implemented **RESTful API** principles.
- Structured with **Onion Architecture** for separation of concerns.
- Used **AutoMapper**, **FluentValidation**, and **EF Core**.
- Built the following modules:
  - `DbContext` configuration.
  - `DbInitializer` for seeding initial data.
  - Generic **Repository** and **Unit of Work** patterns.

### Phase 02: Core Functionalities
- Developed modules: `Auth`, `Service Requests`, `Vehicles`, `Mechanics`, `Customers`.
- Applied Specification Pattern for dynamic filtering and sorting.
- Added image upload functionality for profiles.
- Integrated **Hangfire** to:
  - Auto resend requests.
- Implemented **Fluent Validation** on all DTOs.
- Caching enabled via in-memory or distributed cache.
- Email/SMS services abstraction via `CarCare.Application.Abstraction`.

### Phase 03: Service Request Module
- User Approach
| - Choose Service and choose the Request Type (automatic, manual)
|     - in automatic Request the app Auto-send to next technician using Hangfire if mechanic declines or timeout.
|     - in manual Request the app go to choose another technician by User
| - Go to the payment page
- technician Approach
 - technician receive service requests and respond (Accept, Reject).
 - in automatic Request the app Auto-send to next technician using Hangfire if mechanic declines or timeout.
 - in manual Request the app back to choose another technician by User
- CRUD support with status tracking: Pending, InProgress, Completed, Cancelled.
- Includes advanced filtering (by location, status).

### Phase 04: Vehicle Module
- Users can register vehicles with VIN_Number, Model, Color, Year and plate number.
- Users can Update his vehicle
- Users can Delete his vehicle
- technician sees only related vehicle data.

### Phase 05: Identity & Authentication
- Role-based system: **Admin**, **Technician**, **User**.
- Implemented **JWT Authentication** + **Refresh Tokens**.
- Extended **Swagger UI** for secure testing.
- Password hashing and identity management via `ASP.NET Identity`.

### Phase 06: Contact
- Admin can broadcast messages to all users or for Specific User (Technician or User).
- Admin can Update messages
- Admin can Delete messages

### Phase 06: Feedback
- Users and technician can send Feedback to the app with a message
- they can get thier feedback or update it

### Phase 07: Dashboard & Management
- Admin dashboard for overview of:
  - (Create, Update or Delete) Service Type
  - Total users, technician, requests.
  - Feedback and contact inquiries.
- Export reports.

### Phase 08: Payment Integration
Integrated Stripe for payment processing.
Developed and tested payment endpoints with webhooks for event notifications.
